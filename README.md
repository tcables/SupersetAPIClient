This is a minimally functioning [Apache Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset) API client written in C#, generated by [Microsoft Kiota](https://github.com/microsoft/kiota), and cleaned up by myself. 

This was generated from **Superset v3.1.3**

[Any licensing that Apache requires for Superset shall apply here.](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)

this is a work in progress.
